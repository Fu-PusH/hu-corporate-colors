## Whatâ€™s included
`hu-corporate-colors.less` includes variables for

    @hu-blue
    @hu-black
    @hu-white
    @hu-red
    @hu-green
    @hu-sand
    @hu-gray-green
    @hu-blue-gray

and for each color tints from `@hu-colorname-100` to `@hu-colorname-10` in intervals of ten.

## Importing

Importing works pretty much as expected. You can import the .less file, and all the variables in it will be available. The extension is optionally specified for .less files.

    @import "hu-corporate-colors";
